## About
Pokemon Flood is a fan-created Pokemon game, which takes place in the
antideluvian history of the Pokemon world. The game is browser-based and
single-player. You can play at [flood.lithl.info](https://flood.lithl.info).

## What sets Pokemon Flood apart?
The entire Pokemon Flood game is, in a spiritual sense, a Nuzlocke challenge.
Pokemon can permanently die in the game, and they stay dead. However, this also
applies to enemy Pokemon. If you kill an emey trainer's Pokemon and later face
that same trainer again, they will not have access to the Pokemon you killed.
If you kill wild Pokemon, you will reduce the spawn rate for that species in
that area, potentially even making them go extinct.

Killing the Pokemon of enemy trainers increases the end of battle rewards, but
it will also give a buff to their other Pokemon, making it a dangerous
proposition to do except for that trainer's final Pokemon in the battle. The
vengeful Pokemon will be harder to beat, risking you losing your own Pokemon.
Of course, you get the same bonus if your own Pokemon die.

Finally, changes you've made to the world of Pokemon Flood will cary over to new
games. If you've caused a species to go extinct in one adventure because you've
brutally murdered enough of them in the wild, you will be unable to capture that
species in another adventure.

## How does this killing work, exactly?
All Pokemon have a Vitality attribute in addition to their HP. Tougher Pokemon
will have higher VIT. A fainted Pokemon will lose a portion of their maximum VIT
at the end of each turn, whether they are in the front row of the battle or not.
Like Poison, a fainted Pokemon outside of battle will lose 1 VIT every few
steps.

When a Pokemon hits 0 VIT for any reason, they die permanently. A dead Pokemon
stays in your party until you bury them, and cannot be transferred to your PC.

In addition to gradually losing VIT over time while fainted, a Pokemon's VIT can
be reduced in battle directly. Some moves will damage a Pokemon's VIT without
damaging or in addition to damaging their HP (note: a Pokemon with 0 VIT and
greater than 0 HP will _not_ die, at least not until they hit 0 HP).
Additionally, any damage in excess of an opponent's Pokemon's HP will be applied
to their VIT (although treated as though the Pokemon has +6 stages of Defense
and Special Defense).

Most means of healing Pokemon does not restore VIT.

## What happens if I make every species go extinct?
There are a small number of species that cannot go extinct (such as your options
for starter Pokemon). Generic enemy trainers in a new game will lose access to
Pokemon as you make them go extinct, even potentially losing access to their
entire fighting team (at which point they will no longer challenge you).
Storyline enemy trainers will always have a set number of Pokemon in their
party, but killing Pokemon in their party or causing species to go extinct will
modify what Pokemon their party is comprised of.

If you _do_ manage to make every species extinct that is capable of going
extinct, impressive! A new game will have very little variety of opponents, most
NPCs will not have a party to battle you with, and you will have no wild Pokemon
encounters to train against, meaning completing the game will be _exceptionally_
difficult. But it's certainly an achievement.

## Wait, no random battles and no generic enemy trainers?
Yes! However, if you would like to go back to a more familiar Pokemon
experience, you can reset the world state from the load game/new game screen.
All your genocidal history will be forgotten.
