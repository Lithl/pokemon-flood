### Running the server

* The server expects a file named `db.config.json` located in the `src/server`
directory.
* `db.config.json` should be an object with the properties `dbname`, `user`, and
`password`, which are all strings containing the database name, the name of the
user to access the database with, and that user's password, respectively.

### Setting up the server

* `schema.sql` is generated by mysqldump, and contains the commands necessary to
set up the database.
* Dump the current database schema with the provided `dump.sh` script. This will
include the structure of all tables, but will only include the data for those
tables which are acting as enum values.
